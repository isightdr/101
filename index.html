                  <strong>Decoding the Hazards of Blue Light</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Typically, the wavelength range defining blue light is 400nm-500nm.&nbsp; There are a number of studies that indicate that blue light with wavelengths between 415nm-455nm is also harmful, with the most significant damage to the human eye occurring at wavelengths between 435nm-440nm.<br><strong><br>First, let’s understand the hazards of blue light:</strong><br><br><strong>1.</strong> Blue light is one of the main causes of Visual Display Terminal (VDT) fatigue.<br><strong>2.</strong> It can lead to retinal damage, causing lesions and affecting eye health.<br><strong>3.</strong> Blue light is a major cause of glare.<br><strong>4.</strong> It can disrupt sleep patterns.<br><strong><br>Next, which groups are more suitable for blue light blocking lenses?<br></strong><br><strong>1.</strong> Teenagers (recommended for use when using electronic devices).<br><strong>2.</strong> Individuals who spend long hours in front of computers or are avid gamers.<br><strong>3.</strong> People who frequently use smartphones or electronic screens before bedtime or in dimly lit environments.<br><strong>4.</strong> Individuals with sensitive eyes, high prescription, frequent eye fatigue, and a need for vision protection.<br><strong>5.</strong> People with certain eye conditions such as macular degeneration, hemorrhage, diabetic retinopathy, eye fatigue, post-surgery patients, etc., who require eye protection.<br><br><strong>Many people also have misconceptions about blue light. What are some of these misconceptions?<br></strong><br><em>The human eye has its own built-in light protection mechanism, do we still need to choose blue light blocking lenses?<br></em><br>Research has found that the human eye indeed has a built-in light protection mechanism to counteract the damage caused by blue light, including pupil constriction, squinting, macula lutea (antioxidant properties of the retina), and enzymatic repair mechanisms. However, blue light can exacerbate chromatic aberration and visual blurriness, putting the eyes in a state of strain. Even though the eyes have protective mechanisms, prolonged exposure can lead to eye fatigue.<br>Additionally, when it comes to the eyes of children and adolescents, they are in a developmental stage where the cornea and lens have not fully matured, and many physiological functions are not yet complete. Studies have shown that in the eyes of middle-aged and elderly individuals, there is a natural protective mechanism that can absorb a large amount of blue light, preventing damage to the retina. However, the eyes of children and adolescents do not have such a comprehensive protective mechanism.<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>The Effect of Aging</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The increase in age is associated with a gradual reduction in transmittance at all visible wavelengths, most notably at shorter wavelengths. Transmittance losses related to age occur for every spectral color. Therefore, at the same blue light wavelength, the younger the age, the stronger the lens transmittance, and consequently, the greater the damage to the eyes.<br><br>Moreover, research has indicated that the photopic luminous efficiency of the lens in a 10-year-old child is twice that of a 45-year-old middle-aged person and 3.84 times that of a 65-year-old elderly person.</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Children vs. Adults</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This shows that for the same intensity of blue light emitted from a smartphone screen, children are exposed to blue light damage at a rate twice that of middle-aged individuals and 3.84 times that of the elderly. Middle-aged and elderly individuals have matured eyes, making them less susceptible to blue light damage. If children and adolescents do not protect against blue light, the retinal cells and photoreceptor cells in their eyes are more vulnerable to blue light damage, affecting eye health and leading to the early onset of various retinal complications. Eye cells cannot regenerate, so once damage from blue light occurs, it is irreversible.<br><br><strong>Does blue light blocking lenses affect the visual development of adolescents?<br></strong><br>Using blue light blocking lenses can cause a slight yellowish tint in vision, altering the colors of the objects being viewed. However, it’s important to note that the visual development of adolescents requires natural light sources like sunlight and not the stimulation from artificial light sources. Blue light blocking lenses are only suitable for adolescents to wear when using smartphones, computers, or watching TV and are not recommended for prolonged use.<br></p>

						In order to characterize age-related changes in light transmission of the human lens unrelated to cataracts, researchers at the Glostrup Eye Department of Glostrup Hospital in Denmark measured the spectral transmittance of white light along the visual axis in the central part of the lens. The study evaluated 28 intact human lenses from 15 donors aged 18 to 76 years.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Finally, here are some primary methods for preventing blue light hazards in daily life:<br><br><strong>1. </strong>Reduce continuous eye usage and limit the use of digital devices. Cultivate good eye habits by following the “20-20-20” rule: every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus on an object at least 20 feet away as recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.<br><strong>2.</strong> Maintain a balanced diet, consuming foods high in lutein, vitamin C, and vitamin A.<br><strong>3.</strong> When using the internet or watching TV, lower screen brightness, warm up color temperature, and use soft lighting whenever possible.<br><strong>4.</strong> Avoid using smartphones and computers in dark environments as much as possible.<br><strong>5.</strong> Engage in outdoor activities to effectively enhance eye adjustments and reduce eye fatigue.<br><strong>6.</strong> Wear specialized blue light blocking glasses for eye protection.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Cultivating good eye habits among children and adolescents is the most effective way to prevent blue light hazards. Additionally, wearing blue light blocking lenses appropriately contributes to eye health. People who spend prolonged hours on smartphones and computers should consider wearing blue light blocking glasses. Individuals with existing eye conditions especially need the protection of blue light glasses.</p>
